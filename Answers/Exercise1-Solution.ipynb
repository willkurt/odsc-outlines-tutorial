This is particularly helpful when we don't have any existing data to train a traditional machine learning classifier on. For the purpose of this workshop we're using defaulting to the small but not very powerful `Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instrct` model. This is to ensure this model runs reasonably well on most laptops. This model performs relatively poorly on the task, but if we were to upgrade to something like `Phi-3-medium` we can get 92% accuracy on this task *with no traning examples required!*."
