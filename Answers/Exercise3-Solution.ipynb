    "# Exercise 3: Generating Complaints and the Structured Generation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise we're going to work on a much more involved example. When creating this workshop I didn't want to have to hand write 50 complaints, so I decided to let an LLM do that for me! Typically we would think of a complain as *unstructured* but, as you can see in this exercise, there's almost always an advantage to using structured generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this exercise is a fair be more involved than the last two, but don't worry, you only need to work on a small part of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also going to learn about the [Structured Generation Workflow](https://blog.dottxt.co/coding-for-structured-generation.html) which make it easier to iteratively develop structured applications using LLMs."
